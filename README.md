Contains my CV, available as a rendered Markdown file (preferred since there are no page breaks) or as a PDF.

To view the Markdown version file, simply click on `cv.md`.  If desired you may select, copy, and paste the rendered text into your favorite word editor without hassle, and much of the formatting will be preserved.
